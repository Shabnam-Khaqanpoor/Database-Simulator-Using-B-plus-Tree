# Database-Simulator

## 📂 B+ Tree-Based Database Simulation
This project simulates a **database system** using a **B+ Tree** to efficiently store and manage data. The B+ Tree structure serves as the indexing mechanism, allowing for fast searching, insertion, and deletion of records.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Tree Data Structure Implementation**: Efficiently manages keys and indexes using a **B+ Tree**  
✅ **Database Table Management**: Stores and organizes records with indexing support  
✅ **Indexing Mechanism**: Supports **primary**, **unique**, and **non-unique** indexes for optimized queries  
✅ **Fast Search & Retrieval**: Utilizes tree-based searching for high-speed lookups  
✅ **Automatic Tree Balancing**: Ensures efficient operations by maintaining tree balance

## 📌 Components

### **1️⃣ B+ Tree**
- Implements **insertion, search, and deletion** operations
- Manages **tree balancing** for optimized performance

### **2️⃣ Database Table**
- Simulates a database table with **record storage and indexing**
- Supports **various data types** for flexible information management

### **3️⃣ Indexing System**
- **Primary Index**: Ensures unique identification of records
- **Unique Index**: Guarantees no duplicate values
- **Non-Unique Index**: Supports efficient queries on repeated values
