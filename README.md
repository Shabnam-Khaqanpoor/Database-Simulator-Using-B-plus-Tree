Working with Tree Data Structures                                                                                
Implementing Common Tree Operations                                                                                    
Understanding Databases                                                                                                
                                                                                                               
In this project, we have simulated a database system using a B+ Tree.                                                                                         
This project is designed as a database to store and manage various types of data using a B+ Tree. The keys and indexes of the database are essentially the nodes of the B+ Tree, which enhance access speed to the database entries through tree-based searching.                
The project is divided into several main sections:
                                                                                                                                                 
1. B+ Tree                                                                                                                              
Implementation of B+ Tree with methods for insertion, search, and deletion.                                                                               
Management of tree balancing.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                   
2.Database Table                                                                                                                             
Implementation of a database table with capabilities for record and index management.                                                               
Support for various data types and information management.                                        
                                                                                                             
3.Index                                                                                                             
Creation of primary, unique, and non-unique indexes.
